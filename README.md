## Why this exists

Grok Build is powerful. Butler Grok is the **noob-friendly desk** around it:

- Docked chat + optional floating chat  
- **Projects** with their own chats, Display gallery, and library folders  
- **Display** for reviewing images/video (like / pass / keep, bring to chat)  
- Tasks, folders, marketplace helpers  
- Modes: local Grok CLI, xAI cloud API, or both  
- Animated butler (stills + short video loops)

X / Grok Build users asked for something approachable — this is that starting point. **PRs and forks welcome.**

## Requirements

| Need | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Windows 10/11** (64-bit) | Primary target |
| **Node.js 20+** | For development |
| **Grok Build CLI** (`grok` on PATH) | Mode A / C, marketplace, project Grok terminal |
| **xAI API key** (optional) | Mode B / C — cloud chat, Leo voice, Imagine |

---

## Quick start (developers)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/oshea-davis/butler-grok.git
cd butler-grok
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite + Electron. The first run opens a short wizard.

### Production-style run (no installer)

```powershell
npm run start:prod
```

### Build installer

```powershell
npm run pack
```

Output: `release\\ButlerGrok-Setup-0.1.0.exe`  
Windows builds are **unsigned** by default — SmartScreen may warn on your own builds.

## Connection modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **A** | Local Grok Build only |
| **B** | xAI cloud API (paste key in **Settings**; turn **Demo mode Off**) |
| **C** | Both |

**Never commit API keys.** Enter them only in Settings. See `.env.example` for optional local-only env testing.

## Where your data lives

User chats, settings, and media cache are **local** and **gitignored**:

1. `BUTLER_DATA_DIR` environment variable, if set  
2. Else legacy: `C:\\Grok Build\\Butler Grok\\Data\\` (if that tree already exists)  
3. Else: Electron `userData\\Data\\` (new contributors)

Do not upload `Data/` — it may contain keys and personal chats.

## Contributing

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

High-level: small focused PRs, no secrets, keep the UI approachable for non-programmers while leaving room for power users.

If you use **Grok Build** as your coding agent, point it at this repo and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## Security & privacy

- API keys stay in local Settings / `Data/`  
- `.gitignore` excludes `Data/`, `.env`, build outputs  
- Review your own `Data/settings.json` before any backup you share
